# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a method for tracking changes to a project, including saving different versions at different points in time and/or written by different people, with the purpose of being able to (hopefully) easily identify what changes were made, when changes were made, and who made changes. Version control is useful because it imrpoves workflow management, allows one to more easily see what changes have been made over the course of a project and go back to old versions if necessary. It also enables easier merging of work - automatically rather than manually.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of a "master" version of a project, and it allows one to work on the project while maintaining the original version as is in the master version. Branches can be merged with the master, to update the master version.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point of a branch. A good commit message is specific enough to explain why a change was made.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is an instance where a master and a branch have some different components where text cannot simply be added or deleted, for example, and where additional review is necessary to choose which version is preferred prior to a merge.
