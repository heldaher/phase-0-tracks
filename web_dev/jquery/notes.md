To do:
Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.
-----------------------------------
Plan:
- google jquery for ~15 mins, just reading about what it is, seeming examples of it
- spend ~15 mins practicing writing code in jquery to test what I have learned
- break

- spend ~15 mins watching youtube videos (pick two or so) on jquery tutorials
- spend ~15 mins practicing writing code based on what I have learned
- break

- at this point, after more general overviews of jquery, pick one or two items to focus on - either things I am unclear about or things I want to know more about. Alternate between reviewing and practicing code (ideally code along when researching certain points.)
- before the two hours are up, allow about ~10 mins to make some key notes about what you learned, what to remember, what to look more into in the future, etc.

-------------------------------------
Notes:
- js is a scripting language that can manipulate web pages after they are loaded to the browser.
- "The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website."
- "jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code"
- need to use syntax of document.ready.function (see code for examples)
- use selectors (like CSS) to point to where the jquery code should apply
--------------------------------------
Reflect:
- It seemed that watching tutorials on youtube, and pausing the videos at various spots to try and code along, was the most effective way to learn about jquery for me. It allowed me to see how jquery worked, rather than just conceptually read about it, and seeing various examples was very helpful.
