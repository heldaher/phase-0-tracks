Algorithm for robot using an elevator:

*Starting point: robot is in front of an elevator and knows which floor it wants to go to


1)
- Find where the current floor is provided


2)
- Conditional statement:
	- If floor destination is greater than current floor, press up arrow
		- Else if floor destination is less than current floor, press down arrow
		- Else do not use elevator (as you are already the destination floor)
	- Wait until one set of elevator doors open
- End of conditional statement	


3)
- Loop (once elevator doors have opened):
	- If highlighted up or down arrow does not equal the arrow that was pressed, do not get in elevator
	- If highlighted up or down arrow equals the arrow that was pressed, then 
		- If elevator is empty, enter the elevator
		- If elevator is not empty:
			- Wait until it becomes empty
			- Enter elevator
- End of loop


4)
- Once in elevator, look around until see set of numbers with buttons next to them
- Click the button next to the listed destination floor


5)
- Loop
	- Make sure entire body is within the elevator before the elevator doors close
	- When elevator doors open:
		- If floor on which doors open does not equal destination floor, do not exit.
		- If floor on which doors open equals destination floor, exit!
- End of Loop
